I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineer Department at [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), fortunatedly co-advised by Prof. [Chen Qian](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~qian/) and Prof. [Yang Liu](http://www.yliuu.com/). 

My research interests are incentive design, networks economics and algorithm optimization both in the context of machine learning. 

Before joining UCSC, I received my MEng degree (Cybersecurity) with honor at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Ruiting Zhou](https://ruitingzhou.wordpress.com/) and BEng degrees (Nuclear Engineering and Computer Science) both from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).
